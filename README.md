# finite-automata-sim-dfa-
The purpose of this project is the practical implementation of the theoretical concept of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). 
The program consists of two main parts: one that parses the automaton from the file, and another that checks whether the entered string is accepted by the automaton. Finally, the program returns a response — “Yes” or “No”
The user can easily modify the automaton’s configuration in the file, and the system will work accordingly.
